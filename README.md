## Roadmap and releases

You can see a rough development roadmap in the [Milestones](https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2/milestones) sections.
It is open for changes and input from the community, your [ideas and questions](https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2/issues) are welcome.

> Kimai uses a rolling release concept for delivering updates.
> You don't have to wait for the next official release, upgrade it at any time from the master branch, 
> which is always deployable - release tags are simple snapshots of the development version.

Release versions will be created on a regular basis, every couple of weeks.
Every code change, whether it's a new feature or a bugfix, will be done on the master branch. 
Kimai is actively developed in my spare time, I put my effort into the software instead of back-porting changes.
